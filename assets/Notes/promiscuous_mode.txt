promiscuous mode


When setting up promiscuous mode for a computer, I read the following links:
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/36997/what-is-the-difference-between-promiscuous-and-monitor-mode-in-wireless-networks
	This article covers the difference between promiscuous and monitor mode in reference to wireless network cards.
		The two modes are very similar in nature, however, monitor mode sniffs ALL of the traffic surrounsing the host- this means that you can sniff
		all of the wireless traffic regardless of the access point you are connected to or the network your nic is associated with.
		Promiscuous, on the other hand, sniffs the traffic of the network or access point you are connected to.

https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/WLAN
	This article is written by the folks at Wireshark and goes into great detail about types of traffic, what kind of information may be in the packets,
		how promiscuous and minotor mode work, and most importantly how to set up the different modes with different operating systems...
		
		I need to read the rest of the article
		
https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark/issues/152
	This article seems to imply that phsark will automatically set whatever wireless card/interface your using to promiscuous mode- this could be an importantly
		piece of information, and solve the problem of setting promiscuous mode.
		
Another interesting library (pythonwifi)
http://pythonwifi.tuxfamily.org/
	this library could give us access to our wireless cards or nics, lets us changes the modes they're using, the channels they connect to, etc.
	
And one for wifi access via python:

Equipment Considerations:

	This page lists several pieces of hardware and their ability to capture wifi
